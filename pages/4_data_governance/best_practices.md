- Data Discovery & Assessment: trace and record each data asset’s origin, lineage, what transformations have been applied, and object metadata (including dname of creator, size of object, when it was last updated, etc)

- Data Classification & Organization: evaluate a data asset and scan the content of its attributes to categorize for subsequent organization. This process classifies each data asset in terms of the different levels of data sensitivity, including personal and private data, confidential data, and intellectual property

- Data Cataloging & Management: data catalog contains structural metadata, data object metadata, and levels of sensitivity. The data catalog not only allows data consumers to view this information, but it can also serve as part of a reverse index for search and discovery, both by phrase and (given the right ontologies) by concept

- Data Quality Management: include creating controls for validation, enabling quality monitoring and reporting, supporting the triage process for assessing the level of incident severity, enabling root cause analysis and recommendation of remedies to data issues, and data incident tracking


- Data Access Management:  provision data access to consumers while preventing improper or unauthorized access. It’s important to define identities, groups, and roles, and assign access rights to establish a level of managed access

- Data Protection: It’s important to institute additional methods of data protection to ensure that exposed data cannot be read, including encryption at rest, encryption in transit, data masking, and permanent deletion
