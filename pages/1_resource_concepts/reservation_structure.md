Many times customers will create a central admin project that is used to create different assignments. Assignments are then tied to the projects where the compute is actually occurring.

In this module we went through some common project structures. Here, lets look closer at 


Flex slots:
Rapidly respond to business demands and Evaluate performance.
or Plan for business-critical calendar events. 


Monthly: Ideal balance between flexibility and cost. 


Annual Commitments: The most cost-effective option for steady-state workloads.



Customers can programmatically perform workload management
using Reservations:
Create and delete reservations
Move projects between reservations
Move slots between reservations
Idle slots are seamlessly and
automatically shared in real-time
